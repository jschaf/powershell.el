;;; Installation:

;; Place powershell.el on your `load-path' by adding the following
;; code to your `user-init-file', which is usually ~/.emacs.d/init.el
;; or ~/.emacs.
;;
;; (add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/powershell")
;;

;;; Commentary:

;; powershell.el is a combination of powershell.el by Dino Chiesa
;; <dpchiesa@hotmail.com> and powershell-mode.el by Frédéric Perrin
;; and Richard Bielawski.  Joe Schafer combined the work into a single
;; file.

;;; Frédéric Perrin Comments:
;;
;; The original powershell-mode.el was written from scratch, without
;; using Vivek Sharma's code: it had issues I wanted to correct, but
;; unfortunately there were no licence indication, and Vivek didn't
;; answered my mails.
;;
;;; Rick Bielawski Comments 2012/09/28:
;;
;; On March 31, 2012 Frédéric gave me permission to take over support
;; for powershell-mode.el.  I've added support for multi-line comments
;; and here-strings as well as enhancement/features such as: Functions
;; to quote, unquote and escape a selection, and one to wrap a
;; selection in $().  Meanwhile I hope I didn't break anything.
;;
;; Joe Schafer Comments 2013-06-06:
;;
;; I combined powershell.el and powershell-mode.el.  Since
;; powershell.el was licensed with the new BSD license I combined the
;; two files using the more restrictive license, the GPL.  I also
;; cleaned up the documentation and reorganized some of the code.

;;; Updates:

;; 2012/10/01 Fixed several bugs in highlighting variables and types.
;;            Renamed some variables to be more descriptive.
;; 2012/10/02 Enhanced PowerShell-mode indenting & syntax table.
;;            Fixed dangling parens and re-indented the elisp itself.
;; 2012/10/05 Added eldoc support.  Fixed bug where indent could loop.
;;            See comment below on how to generate powershell-eldoc.el
;; 2013/06/06 Merged powershell.el and powershell-mode.el

;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'thingatpt))
(require 'shell)
(require 'compile)

;;;###autoload
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.ps[dm]?1\\'" . powershell-mode))

;; prompt in powershell. Normally powershell will return its results,
;; then emit a prompt to indicate that it is ready for more input.  In
;; interactive mode it doesn't emit the prompt.  To work around this,
;; this code (powershell.el) sends an explicit `prompt` command after
;; sending any user-entered command to powershell. This tells powershell
;; to explicitly return the prompt, after the results of the prior
;; command. The prompt then shows up in the powershell buffer.  Lovely.
;;
;; But, `ansi-color-apply-on-region` gets called after every command
;; gets sent to powershell. It gets called with args `(begin end)`,
;; which are both markers. Turns out the very first time this fn is
